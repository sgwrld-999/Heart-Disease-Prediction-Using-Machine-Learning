# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques. Leveraging Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn, the goal is to develop a model that achieves an accuracy of over 90%.

## Introduction
Heart disease is a major global health concern, and early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project explores predictive modeling using a dataset containing various health metrics like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other features that may indicate heart disease.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes data distributions and relationships between features.
- **Model Training**: Trains multiple machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
- **Evaluation**: Models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. The primary objective is to achieve an accuracy of over 90%.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of various health-related features, and it is loaded from a CSV file named `heart-disease-csv.csv`.

## Results
The project successfully develops a predictive model with an accuracy exceeding the target of 90%. The notebook provides detailed insights into the data exploration, model training, and evaluation processes.

## Usage
To explore the project, run the notebook `Project_2.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment. The notebook guides you through each step of the analysis and model development.
